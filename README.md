# My 42Network Java Piscine Repository

Welcome to my personal repository for the 42Network Java Piscine! This repository contains my solutions and resources for the Java Piscine program as I work through the challenges and projects.

## About 42Network

42Network is a network of coding schools that emphasizes project-based learning, peer collaboration, and self-directed education. These schools are renowned for their innovative approach to programming education and are committed to fostering a community of passionate coders.

## Java Piscine

The Java Piscine is an intensive coding program within the 42Network ecosystem. It consists of 10 modules, each designed to help learners develop their Java programming skills in a specific area. Here's an overview of the modules:

1. **Module 00**: Learn the basics of solving both trivial and more challenging business tasks using basic Java language constructs.

2. **Module 01**: Model the operation of various collections correctly and create a full-scale money transfer application.

3. **Module 02**: Use input/output in Java and implement programs to manipulate a file system.

4. **Module 03**: Explore basic multithreading mechanisms in Java.

5. **Module 04**: Create library archives and use external libraries.

6. **Module 05**: Use key mechanisms to work with PostgreSQL DBMS via JDBC.

7. **Module 06**: Learn the basics of module and integration testing.

8. **Module 07**: Develop your own frameworks using the reflection and annotations mechanisms.

9. **Module 08**: Dive into enterprise-level Java development and the basics of the Spring framework.

10. **Module 09**: Implement the basic mechanism of a client/server application based on Javaâ€”Sockets API.
